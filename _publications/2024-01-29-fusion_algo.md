excerpt: "We develop an approach focusing on the asymmetry within skin lesions to detect melanomas. An asymmetry model predicts the asymmetry rate of a given lesion, which, when combined with convolutional neural networks, improves the final results and enhances interpretability for dermatologists.<br/><img src='/images/asymmetry.png'>"
