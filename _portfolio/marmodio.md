title: "Marmodio"
excerpt: "A project made during my internship at the Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone along with Charly Lamothe and Pascal Belin. It is a machine learning-based software to denoise, detect, and extract marmoset or other monkey sounds. Once extracted, the sounds can be classified in a semi-supervised manner by experts.<br/><img src='/images/monkey.jpg'>"
